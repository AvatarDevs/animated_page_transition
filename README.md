# material_page_reveal

A basic onboarding style screen flow app which animates to the next screen with a circle, appearing based on the swipe direction

This project was built as a learning experience while coding alongside a Tutorial, which you can see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syd0c9Vi2hg) .

I followed the tuturial, ensuring to understand and absorb the things I was working with - it wasn't mindlessly copied.
